Description: Aim: Adjust the graphical parameters to create nicer
    longitudinal series plots. The default set of graphical parameters is very
    general, and can be improved upon when we are interested in plotting data
    points observed over time. Functions facilitate plotting those kind of
    series, univariate plots, bivariate plots (with vertical axis on both left
    and right hand sides), multivariate plots and plots which allow to examine
    whether a new observation is 'unusual' via construction and visualization
    of prediction intervals around it.
